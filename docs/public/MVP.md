# Qerun MVP  

## 1. Introduction  
The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of Qerun is the first fully working release of our ecosystem.  
It is not a prototype or demo. Instead, it is a **usable foundation** that provides immediate utility to users while being modular enough to expand gradually into a full-featured platform.  

---

## 2. Core Goals of the MVP  
- Deliver a **working and trustworthy product** users can rely on from day one.  
- Establish the **base infrastructure** for decentralized fund and asset management.  
- Demonstrate **clear user value** through safety, transparency, and usability.  
- Keep design **modular**, enabling new features and governance layers to be added without disruption.

## 3. Features Included in the MVP  
- **Withdrawal Alerts**  
  - Get notified before any withdrawal request is executed, giving you time to react and secure assets.  
- **Multi-Signature Vault (Initial Version)**  
  - Funds can be placed in a shared vault managed by a multi-sig setup, ensuring no single party has unilateral control.  
- **Time-Locked Execution**  
  - If a withdrawal or execution does not receive a majority, it is delayed by a timelock before finalization. This ensures decisions are not stuck forever while also giving users a reaction window.  
- **NFT-Backed Participation**  
  - Users can contribute assets (crypto or Qerun NFTs) into the vault. Holders of Qerun NFTs gain the right to participate in governance.  
- **User Dashboard**  
  - A simple web interface where users can manage vaults, review withdrawal requests, and track project state.  
- **Mobile App (Initial Release)**
  - A lightweight mobile version of the dashboard, allowing users to receive withdrawal alerts, check vault activity, and monitor project state on the go.

## 10. FAQ
**Is my money safe?**  
Funds are protected by multi-sig vaults, timelocks, and alerts. However, no system is risk-free. Use responsibly.

**What happens if there is a bug?**  
We will pause affected contracts, communicate openly, and work with the community on fixes.

**When will Phase 2 launch?**  
After the MVP has been validated and community feedback has been addressed.

**Do I need a Qerun NFT to participate?**  
Yes. Qerun NFTs are required for governance participation, but anyone can interact with the vault and dashboard features.
